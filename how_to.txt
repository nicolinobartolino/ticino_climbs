1> Drop .gpx file/s in the gpx folder, named Point A > Point B.gpx

2> run
= python3 auto_add_planned_gpx.py

^This populates the gpx_files.json with the gpx name, adds route to the map and to the climbs_info.json with a status of planned 

2nd python script to run extracts and writes Distance, Elevation and Average gradient, run:
python3 auto_update_climb_info.py

Cheeky extra script to populate start names from gpx file name
python3 update_start_names.py


Run this python script to update progress bar:
python3 update_climb_stats.py
(Re-run if planned > ridden)

Run this to add Cat to start marker
python3 auto_assign_climb_categories.py

Changing status to ridden changes the route to red. 
PB and Strava link can be edited in the file above. 

Manual version (e.g. to enter a single ridden climb manually) 
Launch VS Code, open ticino_climbs folder locally:
Add the new .gpx name in the gpx_files.json
Add the climb info (distance, elev, strava,etc.) in the climbs_info.json [there’s a template for this]
Save and test with live server locally

*NB: manual editing still needed to add PB Time and strava link
